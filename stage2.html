            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <div>
                90-Day Pre-Foreclosure is <b> required </b> to be sent to you under New York State law. The bank must wait at least 90 days from sending this letter before they begin a foreclosure action against you. This 90-day window gives you the opportunity to try to work with the Bank to find an alternative to foreclosure.

                The timing of when you will receive a 90-Day Pre-Foreclosure Notice varies from case to case, but typically if you fall <b>30 or more days</b> behind you will likely receive this letter.
