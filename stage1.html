            <h3>What will happen now?</h3>
            <div>If you have not paid the mortgage, the bank will start contacting you to know when you can pay it. If you have fallen behind <b>1 to 2 months</b> in payment, the bank will tell you that they will start the foreclosure process for your home. Don't worry about your home getting taken away immediately. The foreclosure process takes at least a year. You will have a fair opportunity to get help and try to recover.</div>
