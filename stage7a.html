            <div>
                If you have successfully worked out a deal with the Bank in the Settlement Conference, the 
                foreclosure proceeding will be discontinued.The Bank should file a "Stipulation of Discontinuance", which is a document that tells the Court 
                that the Bank is no longer pursuing a foreclosure.
                In addition, the Bank will file a "Cancellation of the Lis Pendens", 
                which ensures that the land records with the local County Clerk accurately reflect that the foreclosure proceeding is over.
